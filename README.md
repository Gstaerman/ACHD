# ACH depth: The Area of the Convex Hull of Sampled Curves: A Robust Functional Statistical Depth Measure.
=========================================

This repository hosts Python code of the Area of the Convex Hull of Sampled Curves (ACH Depth). The script python FCHD.py contains the algorithm.
Here we provide the source code for the algorithms as well as example notebooks to help get started.

=========================================


Installation
------------

To get the latest version of the code::

  $ git clone https://github.com/Gstaerman/ACHD.git
  
  
Algorithm
---------
ACH Depth is an anomaly detection (and anomaly ranking) algorithm for functional data.
It is defined as an explicite functional statistical depth measure.

Dependencies
------------

These are the dependencies to use FIF:

* numpy
